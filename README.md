## A Note on the Files

Because GitHub has a 100MB file limit, some larger files had to be compressed into `.7z` archives. You’ll need to extract them manually before launching the mod.

All the `.7z` files are in the root `Half-Life 2 Infinite Finality` folder.

Here’s what to do with them:

---

###  Materials

- **`xen_hair.7z`**  
  This archive contains a texture file (`.vtf`).  
  Extract it to:  
  `Half-Life 2 Infinite Finality\materials`

---

###  Maps

These three archives contain map files (`.bsp`).  
Extract the contents of each one to:  
`Half-Life 2 Infinite Finality\maps`

- **`c1m2.7z`**  
- **`c1m4_town.7z`**  
- **`c1m4_town_backup2.7z`**

---

Once you've extracted everything into the right folders, the game should launch without any missing assets.
